Manual QA Guide: Mini Wallet Application

Objective: To verify that all core features of the Mini Wallet application are working correctly from a user's perspective.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Prerequisites & Setup
--------------------------------------------------

Before you begin, ensure your local development environment is fully running:

1. Start the Laravel Web Server:
   php artisan serve

2. Start the Vite Frontend Server:
   npm run dev

3. Run the Queue Worker (MANDATORY for real-time updates):
   php artisan queue:work

4. Prepare Test Users:
   - Your database should be seeded with users.
   - Identify two users from your database to act as the sender and receiver.
   - User A (Sender): Note their email and password.
   - User B (Receiver): Note their email and password.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Test Scenarios
--------------------------------------------------

You will need two separate browser windows or profiles to test the real-time functionality effectively.

- Browser Window 1: Logged in as User A (Sender).
- Browser Window 2: Logged in as User B (Receiver).

Test Case 1: Successful Money Transfer & Real-Time Update

Scenario: User A sends a valid amount of money to User B.

Steps:
1. Login: In Browser 1, log in as User A. In Browser 2, log in as User B.
2. Check Initial State: In both browsers, observe the initial balance and transaction history for each user.
3. Initiate Transfer: In Browser 1 (User A), fill out the "Send Money" form:
   - Recipient Email: Enter the email of User B.
   - Amount: Enter `100`.
4. Submit: Click the "Send" button.

Expected Result:
- In Browser 1 (User A):
  - A success message "Transfer successful!" appears briefly.
  - The form fields are cleared.
  - Instantly (without refresh):
    - The balance decreases by 101.50.
    - A new "Sent to [User B's Name]" transaction appears at the top of the history.
- In Browser 2 (User B):
  - Instantly (without refresh):
    - The balance increases by 100.00.
    - A new "Received from [User A's Name]" transaction appears at the top of the history.

Test Case 2: Insufficient Funds

Scenario: User A attempts to send more money than they have.

Steps:
1. Initiate Transfer: In Browser 1 (User A), enter an amount that is greater than their current balance.
2. Submit: Click "Send".

Expected Result:
- An error message "Insufficient funds." should appear below the amount field.
- The transfer should NOT proceed.
- No changes should occur to any user's balance or transaction history.

---

Test Case 3: Invalid Input Validation

Scenario: User A attempts a transfer with invalid data.

Steps:
1. Test Non-existent User: Enter a fake email address (e.g., no-one@nowhere.com) and a valid amount. Click "Send".
2. Test Self-Transfer: Enter User A's own email address in the recipient field. Click "Send".
3. Test Invalid Amount: Enter a negative number (e.g., -50) or zero in the amount field. Click "Send".

Expected Result (for all steps):
- A clear validation error message appears under the relevant form field.
- The transfer should NOT proceed.
- No changes should occur to any user's balance or transaction history.
